# Predicting-Fuel-Efficiency-Using-TensorFlow
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to build and train a machine learning model aimed at predicting the fuel efficiency of vehicles. The notebook walks through the entire process from data preprocessing and model creation to training and evaluation. It's designed to provide a practical introduction to using TensorFlow for regression tasks, with clear explanations and visualizations to support key concepts. Ideal for beginners looking to dive into machine learning with a hands-on approach.

# Features of the Notebook:
- Data Exploration: An in-depth analysis of the vehicle dataset, visualizing key variables and their relationships to fuel efficiency.
- Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing the data for modeling, including normalization and handling missing values.
- Model Building: Step-by-step guide on creating a neural network using TensorFlowâ€™s Keras API, tailored for regression tasks.
- Model Evaluation: Methods for assessing model performance using validation and testing datasets to ensure robustness and reliability.
- Prediction and Interpretation: Demonstrations of how to use the model to make predictions and interpret the results to gain insights into what affects fuel efficiency.
